# Tic Tac Toe

The world's most over-engineered tic-tac-toe game. It's really all too much. ü§£

I've built this project as part of my blog post series "Getting started with modern front-end development". The goal is to help you understand how to build a web app from scratch, with all modern development tools available at this time (mid 2020).

If you like reading, you can start by this post, which is the very first one where I get this project started and explain all the technologies used in depth.

In the other hand, if you prefer to read through the source code, checkout the branches. Each branch corresponds to a single blog post, and you'll be able to follow the app development step by step.

P.S.: by over-engineered I mean: a simple tic-tac-toe game could be built with A LOT less complexity. Even Google has it already done. So, don't get this code as a rule. It's more to showcase how to use Javascript and other front-end technologies to build any app. üòÅ

## Getting Started

Simply clone this repo, and run the commands below to get it running in your local machine:

```
# Clone repo to your machine
$ git clone git@github.com:wederribas/tic-tac-toe.git & cd clone/

# Install dependencies (I use yarn, but npm will work just as fine)
$ yarn #or npm install

# Run the app. This will start the local server.
$ yarn serve #or npm run serve
```

## Deployment

You can deploy this app in any platform as a static app. I personally use Netlify. But feel free to use Vercel, Heroku, Digital Ocean, AWS S3, or anything you'd like.

In order to use Netlify, follow the [instructions here](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/09/29/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-on-netlify/).
